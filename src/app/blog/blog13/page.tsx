        Digital Dopamine: How Your Phone is Rewiring Your Brain (And What to Do About It)
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-4">
        You checked your phone just 5 minutes ago. And you’ll probably check it again before you finish this blog. Sound familiar?
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        In today’s digital world, apps are designed to keep you hooked — every like, ping, and scroll triggers your brain’s reward system.
        This constant stimulation gives you small doses of dopamine — the brain chemical that makes you feel good — just like sugar or caffeine.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">What is Digital Dopamine?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that motivates you to seek rewards. Traditionally, we’d get dopamine from activities like exercising,
        socializing, or achieving goals. But now, your phone is offering instant dopamine — through notifications, likes, and endless feeds.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">How It’s Changing Your Brain</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Shorter attention span — you switch apps constantly.</li>
        <li>Increased anxiety — you feel restless when offline.</li>
        <li>Poor sleep — late-night scrolling disrupts sleep cycles.</li>
        <li>Less satisfaction from real-life activities — real rewards feel slower.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Signs You Might Be Hooked</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>You check your phone first thing in the morning.</li>
        <li>You scroll even when you’re bored or not interested.</li>
        <li>You feel anxious when you forget your phone.</li>
        <li>You open Instagram or YouTube out of habit — not need.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">How to Fix It (Without Deleting Instagram)</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>⏳ Use app timers (Digital Wellbeing, iOS Screen Time, One Sec app).</li>
        <li>📵 Try a dopamine detox — 1 day a week with no social media or screens.</li>
        <li>📚 Replace scrolling with real hobbies like reading, drawing, or walking.</li>
        <li>🛏️ Set no-phone zones: avoid screens during meals, mornings, and before bed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Your phone is not evil — it’s a tool. But if you don’t use it mindfully, it will use you. Start small: bring awareness, set boundaries,
        and take control back from the algorithm.
      </p>

      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 mb-6">
        “Your phone is a tool — not your master. Take back control.”
