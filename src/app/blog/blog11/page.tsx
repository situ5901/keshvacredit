          Financial freedom starts with a very simple, but often overlooked question: <strong>“Where does my money go every month?”</strong> 
          Most people have a vague idea, but when you sit down and look closely, the reality can be eye-opening. 
          From little purchases to monthly subscriptions, your expenses quickly add up.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">📊 Why It’s Important to Track Every Rupee</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding your spending habits helps you:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>Identify and reduce unnecessary expenses</li>
          <li>Create a realistic budget</li>
          <li>Set better savings and investment goals</li>
          <li>Control impulse spending</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">🔍 The Hidden Drains on Your Income</h2>
        <p>
          Most people underestimate how much they spend on food delivery, online shopping, or streaming services. 
          ₹300 here, ₹500 there—it adds up. Without tracking, you're left wondering why your bank balance 
          feels lighter every week.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">💡 Tools That Can Help You Track Spending</h2>
        <p>
          You don’t need to rely on memory or spreadsheets. There are plenty of apps that sync with your bank 
          accounts and automatically categorize your spending. Some popular ones in India include:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li><strong>Walnut:</strong> Tracks SMS alerts to map expenses</li>
          <li><strong>Money View:</strong> Visualizes your cash flow</li>
          <li><strong>ET Money:</strong> Tracks bills and helps plan investments</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">🧠 Awareness Leads to Better Habits</h2>
        <p>
          Once you see exactly where your money is going, you’ll start making better choices naturally. 
          Maybe you’ll cook more meals at home, cancel a forgotten subscription, or start saving before spending.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">🏁 Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          You can’t fix what you don’t see. If you want to save more, invest smartly, or reach your 
          financial goals, the first and most powerful step is understanding your spending. 
          The sooner you take control, the sooner you’ll move toward financial freedom.
        </p>
