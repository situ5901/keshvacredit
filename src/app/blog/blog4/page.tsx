        <p>
          A strong <strong>CIBIL score</strong> (typically between 300–900) is your gateway to better loans, credit cards, interest rates, and even rental agreements. In India, a score above 750 is considered excellent, while anything under 600 may limit your financial options.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. 💡 Understand the CIBIL Score Breakdown</h2>
        <p>CIBIL scores are derived from five key factors:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>Repayment history (~35%)</li>
          <li>Credit utilisation (~30%)</li>
          <li>Length & age of credit (~15%)</li>
          <li>New credit inquiries (~10%)</li>
          <li>Credit mix (~10%)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Knowing how much each factor weighs helps you prioritize your efforts. For example, one missed payment can ding your score by 60–100 points.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2. ✅ Always Pay Bills & EMIs on Time</h2>
        <p>
          Payment history is king—it’s the largest score driver (35%). On-time payments demonstrate financial reliability to lenders.  
          <strong>Action:</strong> Set up auto-debit, reminders, or calendar alerts. Prioritize full payments over minimum dues.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those rebuilding from debt, paying even slightly above the minimum each month sends a strong positive signal.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. 📉 Maintain Credit Utilisation Below 30%</h2>
        <p>
          Credit utilisation shows how much credit you’re using vs. what’s available. Over 30% is a red flag to lenders.  
          Example: If your limit is ₹100,000, try keeping your balance under ₹30,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Strategies:</strong> Pay balances mid-cycle, ask for a higher credit limit (if responsibly managed), or spread usage across cards.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">4. 🧱 Build a Strong Credit Mix</h2>
        <p>
          Having both secured (home, auto) and unsecured (credit card, personal loan) credit shows lenders you're experienced and responsible.  
          <strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you have only credit cards, consider a small loan. If you only have loans, a secured credit card can help diversify.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">5. 📄 Keep Credit Accounts Open for Longer</h2>
        <p>
          The average age of your accounts impacts about 15% of your score.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">6. 🛑 Limit Hard Inquiries</h2>
        <p>
          Each loan or credit inquiry triggers a hard pull (~10%).  
          <strong>Tip:</strong> Space applications 3–6 months apart, and apply only when necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daily reporting (new RBI mandate) will make credit trends more real-time—so a sudden flurry of loans won’t go unnoticed.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">7. 🔍 Check & Dispute Report Errors Regularly</h2>
        <p>
          Access your free credit report annually from the four bureaus (CIBIL, Equifax, Experian, High Mark). Errors like missed payments or duplicates can drag you down.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">8. 💳 Consider Secured Credit Cards or Gold Loans</h2>
        <p>
          If you’re rebuilding credit (score below 600), secured products like gold loans or FD-backed cards can help.  
          These are easier to get, help you build repayment history, and can improve your score fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Sameer Mathur explains, “Secured credit… are easier to obtain even with a low credit score and can help rebuild credit when repaid consistently.”
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">9. 🎯 Tackle & Settle Outstanding Debts</h2>
        <p>
          Settling old dues (especially reported as overdue or charged-off) can remove big negative entries. However, note that “settled” status isn’t as good as “paid in full,” and may still leave a mark.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, it shows responsibility. Lance a negotiation, pay part or full, and monitor to ensure it's updated in your report.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">10. 📆 Plan Long Horizons & Income Stability</h2>
        <p>
          Picking longer repayment tenures (like 5-year vs 3-year) can lower EMI pressure, helping ensure timely payments.  
          Also, increasing your income (side gigs, freelancing) can improve debt-to-income ratio, lowering utilization.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">11. ⏱️ Be Patient: Results Take Time</h2>
        <p>
          Improving your CIBIL score by 150–200 points may take 4–12 months of sustained effort.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">12. 🧠 Stay Updated on 2025 Trends</h2>
        <p>
          New tech—like daily credit reporting, alternate data (utility/app usage)—is making credit evaluation faster and richer. Use tools like the CIBIL app and smart spenders who earn reward points are being noticed.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">🏁 Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          A high CIBIL score opens doors: lower interest rates, premium financial options, and peace of mind. To hit a strong score in 2025:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Pay on time, always</li>
          <li>Spend less than 30% of your credit</li>
          <li>Keep accounts long and balanced</li>
          <li>Apply sparingly, check your report often</li>
          <li>Use secured credit if rebuilding</li>
          <li>Stay disciplined over months</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With consistency and awareness, you'll not only boost your score—you'll establish strong financial habits.  
          <strong>Your credit health in 2025 isn't just a number; it's a foundation for brighter opportunities.</strong>
