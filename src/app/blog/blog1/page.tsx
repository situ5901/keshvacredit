          Saving tax legally is not just about reducing your financial burden—it's about making smarter financial decisions that align with government policies. Every salaried employee in India has access to several provisions under the Income Tax Act that help reduce taxable income while promoting savings and investment.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Understand the Basics of Income Tax</h2>
        <p>
          India follows a slab system for income tax. As your income increases, so does the percentage of tax you pay. Knowing your tax bracket is the first step in planning savings efficiently. For the financial year 2024–25, salaried employees can choose between the old and new tax regimes.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Section 80C – Your Primary Tax-Saving Tool</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most commonly used sections for tax saving is Section 80C. It allows deductions up to ₹1.5 lakh annually on eligible investments and expenditures. Some of the popular instruments under this section include:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>Employee Provident Fund (EPF)</li>
          <li>Public Provident Fund (PPF)</li>
          <li>National Savings Certificate (NSC)</li>
          <li>Life Insurance Premiums</li>
          <li>Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS)</li>
          <li>Home Loan Principal Repayment</li>
          <li>Tuition Fees for Children</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Use the National Pension Scheme (NPS) – Section 80CCD(1B)</h2>
        <p>
          Over and above the 80C limit, you can claim an additional ₹50,000 by investing in the National Pension Scheme. It not only reduces your taxable income but also helps build a retirement corpus.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">4. Claim HRA – House Rent Allowance</h2>
        <p>
          If you live in a rented house, HRA can be a significant tax saver. To claim HRA:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>Your salary structure must include HRA</li>
          <li>You should be paying rent</li>
          <li>You need to submit rent receipts as proof</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The exemption amount depends on factors like your salary, HRA received, rent paid, and location of residence.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">5. Deduction on Home Loan Interest – Section 24(b)</h2>
        <p>
          If you’ve taken a home loan, you can claim a deduction up to ₹2 lakh on the interest paid per financial year under Section 24(b). This is separate from the ₹1.5 lakh you can claim under 80C for principal repayment.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">6. Health Insurance – Section 80D</h2>
        <p>
          Premiums paid towards medical insurance for yourself, your spouse, children, or parents are eligible for deductions:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>₹25,000 for self and family</li>
          <li>Additional ₹25,000 (or ₹50,000 if parents are senior citizens) for parents</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This not only provides financial security but also helps reduce taxes.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">7. Education Loan – Section 80E</h2>
        <p>
          The interest paid on an education loan is fully deductible for up to 8 years under Section 80E. There's no cap on the amount, but it must be for higher education and taken from a recognized financial institution.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">8. Leave Travel Allowance (LTA)</h2>
        <p>
          LTA can be claimed for travel expenses incurred during domestic holidays. It covers only travel (not food or stay), and is applicable for 2 journeys in a block of 4 years.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">9. Standard Deduction</h2>
        <p>
          Salaried employees get a flat ₹50,000 deduction from their taxable salary income every year without the need to show any proof.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">10. Donations – Section 80G</h2>
        <p>
          Donations made to specified funds and charitable institutions are eligible for deduction under Section 80G. Ensure you get a receipt and that the organization is eligible under this section.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">11. Choose Between Old and New Regimes</h2>
        <p>
          Under the new regime, many exemptions like 80C, HRA, etc., are not available, but tax slabs are lower. It may be better for individuals with fewer deductions. Use a tax calculator or consult a CA to decide what's best for you.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">12. Reimbursements and Perks</h2>
        <p>
          Use tax-free perks like meal coupons, mobile bill reimbursements, and fuel reimbursements. Many employers offer these as part of the CTC structure.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Tax planning doesn’t mean tax evasion. It’s about using legitimate provisions of the law to your advantage. The Income Tax Act is filled with benefits that promote savings, health care, home ownership, and education. By being proactive and informed, salaried employees can significantly reduce their tax liability while also achieving financial goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Always consult a qualified financial advisor or chartered accountant to make the most of the applicable deductions and avoid any compliance issues.
