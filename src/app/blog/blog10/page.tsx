          Personal loans have evolved significantly in India over the past decade. With the emergence of digital-first NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies) and fintech lenders, the personal loan space is no longer limited to traditional banks. In 2025, consumers enjoy faster loan approvals, tailored interest rates, and easier access to credit — especially in urban and semi-urban areas. This guide covers every essential aspect of eligibility for personal loans this year.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">📌 What Is Personal Loan Eligibility?</h2>
        <p>
          Personal loan eligibility defines the criteria set by NBFCs and financial institutions to evaluate a borrower's capacity to repay the loan. Lenders assess applicants based on income, employment history, credit score, age, and overall financial discipline. In 2025, many NBFCs are also leveraging AI-based risk assessment and alternative credit scoring models to include a broader audience, including gig workers and first-time borrowers.
